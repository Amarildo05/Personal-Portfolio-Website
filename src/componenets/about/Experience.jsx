        I have had the opportunity to work on real projects and collaborate with
        clients, which has helped me build valuable practical experience. Here
        are some key examples:

      <h3>E-Commerce Project</h3>
      <p>
        Played a key role in a complex e-commerce platform built with{" "}
        <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong>PrimeReact</strong>. The
        project included multiple real-world features such as order management
        and client dashboards. This experience strengthened my skills in
        collaborative development, problem-solving, and delivering high-quality
        solutions on a professional team.
