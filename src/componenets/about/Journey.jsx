        My Journey
      </h2>
      <p>
        My journey into programming started with a deep curiosity about how the
        digital world operates. I was fascinated by the ability to transform
        abstract ideas into working code, and this fascination sparked my
        interest in web development. I began by following simple online
        tutorials, gradually expanding my knowledge and diving into more complex
        resources and documentation. As I became more engaged in programming, I
        realized the power of JavaScript and its ecosystem in building dynamic,
        interactive web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        To formalize and deepen my knowledge, I enrolled in several online
        courses, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>- JavaScript Basics</li>
        <li>- Web Development Guide</li>
        <li>- Next.js 15 & React - The Complete Guide (Udemy)</li>
        <li>
          - The Next.js 13 Bootcamp - The Complete Developer Guide (Udemy)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These courses helped me build a strong foundation in JavaScript, web
        development, and popular frameworks. The next step in my journey was the{" "}
        <strong>
          JavaScript Bootcamp at Software Development Academy (SDA)
        </strong>{" "}
        by Protik in Tirana, Albania. This experience greatly enhanced my
        practical skills in frontend development, while also providing a
        foundational understanding of backend concepts and how they integrate
        with the frontend. Here are the key elements I gained from the bootcamp:
