        My Journey
      </h2>
      <p>
        I recently completed a <strong>JavaScript Bootcamp</strong> at{" "}
        <strong>SDA by Protik</strong> in Tirana, Albania, where I gained a
        solid foundation in web development. Before that, I completed several
        online courses, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>- JavaScript Basics</li>
        <li>- Web Development Guide</li>
        <li>- Next.js 15 & React - The Complete Guide (Udemy)</li>
        <li>
          - The Next.js 13 Bootcamp - The Complete Developer Guide (Udemy)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These courses gave me a strong understanding of how web development
        works, and the bootcamp enhanced my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        TypeScript, and React. My goal is to keep growing and refining my
        expertise to tackle complex challenges.
